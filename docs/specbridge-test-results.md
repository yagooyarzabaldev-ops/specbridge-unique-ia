# SpecBridge Test Results

## Purpose

This document records the current local test evidence for SpecBridge.

CI evidence must still be read from GitHub pull request checks after the branch is pushed.

## Test Run

- Date: 2026-05-20
- Environment: local PowerShell workspace
- Branch: `codex/live-antigravity-executor-handoff`
- Scope: Live Antigravity executor handoff preparation with file-backed packets

## Results

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Foundation validation | passed |
| Contract validation | passed |
| Contract scope validation | passed |
| Schema validation | passed |
| Final report validation | passed |
| Audit packet validation | passed |
| ChatGPT audit validation | passed |
| Executor packet validation | passed |
| Security gate validation | passed |
| Local CLI validation | passed |
| Controlled implementation pilot CLI feature | passed |
| Multi-agent pilot validation | passed |
| Executor handoff validation | passed |
| PR review report validation | passed |
| Claude review workflow validation | passed |
| Autonomous execution protocol validation | passed |
| Review gate validation | passed |
| Negative validation suite | passed |
| Smoke validation | passed |
| Git diff check | passed |

## Negative Test Coverage

The negative validation suite verifies:

- missing required foundation file fails
- incomplete execution contract fails
- disjoint active contract scope manifests pass
- missing contract scope `exclusive_write` fails
- conflicting active contract write paths fail
- duplicate contract scope final report paths fail
- valid audit packet fixture generation passes
- audit packet generation with missing execution contract fails
- audit packet missing required field fails
- audit packet with raw diff field fails
- valid ChatGPT audit fixture passes
- ChatGPT audit missing required dimension fails
- approved ChatGPT audit with blocking finding fails
- non-approved ChatGPT audit with merge allowed fails
- safe security gate fixture passes
- secret-like content fails with the expected security category
- auth-sensitive path fails with the expected security category
- authorization-sensitive path fails with the expected security category
- CI/CD permission escalation fails with the expected security category
- dependency manifest addition fails with the expected security category
- unsafe shell command content fails with the expected security category
- protected path change fails with the expected security category
- production configuration path fails with the expected security category
- local CLI status command passes
- local CLI status latest artifacts command passes
- local CLI validation command passes
- local CLI contract generation passes and validates
- local CLI final report generation passes and validates
- local CLI audit packet generation passes and validates
- local CLI task decomposition passes
- local CLI executor handoff packet generation passes and validates
- local CLI conflict detection passes
- local CLI review gate passes
- local CLI missing output path fails deterministically
- multi-agent pilot three-slice decomposition passes
- multi-agent pilot duplicate write scope fails deterministically
- executor handoff three-packet generation passes
- executor handoff duplicate branch fails deterministically
- incomplete final report fails
- blocked PR path fails

## Policy Result

Passed. The change adds file-backed Antigravity executor handoff packets, deterministic packet validation, CLI handoff generation, smoke coverage, documentation, context updates, an execution contract, a scope manifest, audit evidence, audit packet evidence, and a final report only. It does not add secrets, production configuration, deployment automation, billing, hosted dashboard implementation, MCP server implementation, GitHub App implementation, database schema implementation, authentication implementation, authorization implementation, branch protection weakening, dependency installation, or CI/CD security weakening.

## Unresolved Risks

- CI evidence is pending until the branch is pushed and GitHub runs checks.
- Auto-merge behavior should be verified on this pull request after checks pass.
- Live parallel Antigravity Claude Code sessions are prepared as handoff packets but are not launched by this repository-first task.
